Online examination systems offer flexibility, scalability, and convenience for both educators and students. This project presents the design and implementation of an online examination system using PHP. The system is developed to facilitate the creation, management, and evaluation of exams in an online environment. It incorporates features such as user authentication, exam creation, exam scheduling, real-time exam monitoring, and result generation. The system is implemented using PHP programming language along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development. MySQL database is utilized for s retrieval. It aims to enhance the assessment process in educational institutions by leveraging the power of web-based technologies.
The system leverages modern web technologies to offer a secure and scalable solution that can handle a large number of concurrent users. It supports various types of questions such as multiple-choice, short answer, and essay formats, accommodating diverse assessment needs. Real-time monitoring tools help maintain the integrity of the examination process, with options for proctoring via webcam and screen recording.
